# microservice_timestamp

## User Story
- [ ] I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
- [ ] If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- [ ] If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

## What is Microservices
Microservices is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. 
Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services.
For this project, I will build a timestamp module that to check whether the string that is passed to the module contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date.
